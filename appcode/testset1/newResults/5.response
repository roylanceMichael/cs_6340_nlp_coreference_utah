It is now broadly accepted that <COREF ID='X2'>virulent APMV-1 viruses</COREF> generally arise in
<COREF ID='X3'>poultry</COREF> by <COREF ID='X5'>mutation</COREF> of viruses of <COREF ID='X6'>low virulence</COREF> after these <COREF ID='1' REF='X2'>viruses</COREF> have
been introduced into <COREF ID='2' REF='X3'>poultry</COREF> flocks (Alexander DJ, British Poultry Science
42, 5-22, 2001). Since <COREF ID='X18'>this ND virus</COREF> reported from Victoria is almost
identical to the 1999 Mangrove Mountain isolate, then <COREF ID='X20'>it</COREF> appears more than
a remote probability that <COREF ID='X30'>the same precursor virus</COREF> (so-called Peat's Ridge
<COREF ID='3' REF='X30'>strain</COREF> ) may have been present in <COREF ID='X36'>these Victorian</COREF> <COREF ID='4' REF='X20'>flocks</COREF> for some time and a
very similar <COREF ID='5' REF='X5'>mutation</COREF> event has resulted in this virulent <COREF ID='6' REF='X30'>virus</COREF> . This
raises further questions regarding the distribution of <COREF ID='X41'>such precursor</COREF>
<COREF ID='X46'>viruses</COREF> in Australia.
For countries or regions claiming <COREF ID='7' REF='X18'>ND</COREF> freedom, this outbreak again
underlines the need for continuous serosurveillance of <COREF ID='8' REF='2'>poultry</COREF> <COREF ID='9' REF='4'>flocks</COREF> with
immediate epidemiological investigation (including attempts to isolate and
classify any <COREF ID='10' REF='X2'>APMV-1</COREF> viruses circulating) at the first sign of
seroconversion in <COREF ID='11' REF='9'>flocks</COREF> .
[ <COREF ID='12' REF='11'>Newcastle disease</COREF> virus is a notoriously variable <COREF ID='13' REF='6'>virus</COREF> . Strains of
<COREF ID='14' REF='12'>Newcastle disease</COREF> <COREF ID='15' REF='13'>virus</COREF> differ widely in <COREF ID='50' REF='X6'>virulence</COREF> , depending on the
<COREF ID='X76'>cleavability and activation</COREF> of <COREF ID='16' REF='15'>their</COREF> hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and fusion
membrane proteins. Avirulent strains produce inactive precursor <COREF ID='17' REF='16'>proteins</COREF> ,
whereas in <COREF ID='X81'>virulent strains</COREF> the precursor <COREF ID='18' REF='17'>proteins</COREF> are cleaved and
activated readily. Since the spread of infection is dependent on cleavage
occurring in <COREF ID='X89'>the same tissue</COREF> in which replication occurs, the presence of
specific cellular proteases as well as the inherent <COREF ID='19' REF='X76'>cleavability</COREF> of the
surface glycoprotein <COREF ID='20' REF='X41'>precursors</COREF> determines the <COREF ID='21' REF='X89'>tissue</COREF> tropism of <COREF ID='X97'>virus</COREF>
<COREF ID='22' REF='X81'>strains</COREF> and <COREF ID='23' REF='22'>their</COREF> ability to spread rapidly. <COREF ID='X102'>This</COREF> is the <COREF ID='24' REF='23'>basis</COREF> for the
definition of <COREF ID='25' REF='22'>strains</COREF> of <COREF ID='26' REF='14'>Newcastle disease</COREF> <COREF ID='27' REF='X97'>virus</COREF> as velogenic (or
viscerotropic), mesogenic, or lentogenic for <COREF ID='28' REF='25'>strains</COREF> of high, intermediate,
or low <COREF ID='29' REF='50'>virulence</COREF> , respectively. A consequence of <COREF ID='30' REF='X102'>this</COREF> is that the number of
mutational steps between avirulence and high <COREF ID='51' REF='29'>virulence</COREF> may be quite small,
and as Howard Pharo suggests, <COREF ID='31' REF='28'>strains</COREF> of high <COREF ID='32' REF='51'>virulence</COREF> could potentially
arise independently from the same (or a closely related) precursor <COREF ID='33' REF='27'>virus</COREF> of
low virulence. Consequently, this should be taken into consideration in any
disease surveillance programme. A possible complicating factor, however, is
that the source of the precursor <COREF ID='34' REF='X46'>viruses</COREF> may not be domestic <COREF ID='35' REF='8'>poultry</COREF> . - Mod.CP]
