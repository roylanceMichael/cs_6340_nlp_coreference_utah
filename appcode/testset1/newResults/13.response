By PATRICIA YOUNG
c.1996 South China Morning Post <COREF ID='6' REF='1'>The Russian airline Aeroflot</COREF> has been hit with <COREF ID='X13'>a writ</COREF> for loss
and damages, filed in <COREF ID='X20'>Hong Kong</COREF> by <COREF ID='7' REF='2'>the families</COREF> of seven passengers
killed in an air crash.
All 75 people on board <COREF ID='X29'>the Aeroflot Airbus</COREF> died when <COREF ID='12' REF='X13'>it</COREF> ploughed
into a Siberian mountain in March 1994.
Aeroflot general manager for Hong Kong Vassili Tkatchenko said
on Tuesday <COREF ID='15' REF='X29'>he</COREF> was unaware <COREF ID='16' REF='X13'>the writ</COREF> had been filed. <COREF ID='17' REF='X13'>The writ</COREF> is for ``damages, interest and costs'' of seven
passengers who died when <COREF ID='19' REF='X29'>the Moscow Airbus A310 flight</COREF> bound for <COREF ID='22' REF='X20'>Hong Kong</COREF> crashed at Novokuznetsk, Siberia. <COREF ID='23' REF='12'>It</COREF> claims <COREF ID='24' REF='15'>the deaths</COREF> were ``caused by negligence, breach of
statutory duty and breach of contract on the part of <COREF ID='25' REF='15'>the defendant</COREF>
[ <COREF ID='26' REF='6'>Aeroflot</COREF> ].''
<COREF ID='X67'>Air industry investigators</COREF> say the 15-year-old son of Captain
Yaroslav Kudrinsky was flying <COREF ID='27' REF='22'>the Hong Kong-bound aircraft</COREF> after <COREF ID='29' REF='23'>it</COREF>
left Moscow. Black box transcripts show <COREF ID='31' REF='X67'>Eldar</COREF> and Yana, <COREF ID='32' REF='X67'>his 13-year-old sister</COREF> , were in the cockpit prior to the crash.
<COREF ID='X81'>Airline passengers</COREF> are protected under a section of the Warsaw
Convention relating to air travel which was signed on October 12,
1929.
The liability of the carrier for death or personal injury to <COREF ID='35' REF='X81'>passengers</COREF> has an upper limit of US$75,000. But larger amounts have
been awarded through <COREF ID='X98'>the courts</COREF> or through out-of-court
settlements.
Aviation consultant Steve Miller, <COREF ID='37' REF='15'>the managing director</COREF> of
Trinity Aviation, said <COREF ID='38' REF='X98'>he</COREF> was unaware of any aviation court
settlements in <COREF ID='39' REF='22'>Hong Kong</COREF> .
``Taking <COREF ID='40' REF='29'>it</COREF> to <COREF ID='X116'>the courts</COREF> is very unusual for <COREF ID='41' REF='39'>Hong Kong</COREF> ,'' <COREF ID='42' REF='X116'>Mr Miller</COREF> said.
Six of the claims in <COREF ID='43' REF='16'>the writs</COREF> were filed by <COREF ID='44' REF='41'>family members who live outside Hong Kong</COREF> .
