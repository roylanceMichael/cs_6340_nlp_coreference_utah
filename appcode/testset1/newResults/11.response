WASHINGTON @amp;MD; The <COREF ID='5' REF='X13'>U.S. Navy</COREF> ordered all of <COREF ID='6' REF='X13'>its F-14s</COREF> out of the
<COREF ID='X41'>skies</COREF> for <COREF ID='X44'>at least three days</COREF> after <COREF ID='80' REF='X41'>one of them</COREF> crashed on <COREF ID='X42'>Thursday</COREF>
in the Persian Gulf, <COREF ID='10' REF='X44'>the third crash</COREF> of <COREF ID='X46'>an F-14</COREF> in the last month.
<COREF ID='X54'>The two-man crew</COREF> survived <COREF ID='11' REF='10'>the crash</COREF> , ejecting into the northern
waters of <COREF ID='12' REF='X44'>the gulf</COREF> , and were rescued and returned to the carrier
Nimitz. <COREF ID='13' REF='X54'>The two crewmen</COREF> , who were not identified, were reported to have
suffered minor injuries.
<COREF ID='X70'>The three-day shutdown</COREF> of <COREF ID='15' REF='X46'>the Navy's fleet of more than 330 F-14s</COREF> was ordered by the chief of naval operations, <COREF ID='18' REF='15'>Adm. Jeremy M. Boorda</COREF> , who said in an interview at the Pentagon that while there
was no immediate evidence of a connection among <COREF ID='19' REF='X44'>the three crashes</COREF> ,
``This is <COREF ID='20' REF='19'>an airplane</COREF> that <COREF ID='21' REF='X42'>we</COREF> worry about.''
`` <COREF ID='22' REF='20'>A jinxed airplane</COREF> ?'' <COREF ID='23' REF='X41'>he</COREF> said. ``No. But known deficiencies in
the earlier models? Yes, and <COREF ID='24' REF='X42'>we</COREF> 're working on that, including some
<COREF ID='X100'>changes</COREF> to <COREF ID='25' REF='24'>the aircraft</COREF> .'' <COREF ID='26' REF='X100'>He</COREF> said <COREF ID='27' REF='X70'>the three-day review</COREF> might result in new restrictions on
use of <COREF ID='29' REF='24'>the plane</COREF> , nicknamed the Tomcat, which has the highest
accident rate for jet <COREF ID='X112'>fighters</COREF> in the <COREF ID='31' REF='5'>Navy</COREF> fleet. <COREF ID='X113'>Ten F-14s</COREF> have
gone down in the past two years, <COREF ID='X120'>and 32</COREF> since 1991. <COREF ID='X121'>Each plane</COREF>
costs more than $30 million.
`` <COREF ID='32' REF='X112'>We</COREF> may come out with some more operational restrictions, but
it's way too early to say that,'' <COREF ID='33' REF='24'>the admiral</COREF> said. ``This is too
serious a business to be guessing about.''
<COREF ID='X135'>Navy officials</COREF> said <COREF ID='X133'>that</COREF> during <COREF ID='35' REF='X70'>the shutdown</COREF> , special engineers
and other safety experts would review the evidence available from <COREF ID='36' REF='19'>the three recent crashes</COREF> and inspect the rest of <COREF ID='37' REF='15'>the fleet</COREF> for
<COREF ID='X145'>defects</COREF> in <COREF ID='38' REF='X121'>the planes</COREF> , in <COREF ID='39' REF='X145'>their</COREF> maintenance, or in pilot training. <COREF ID='40' REF='X112'>Earlier models of the fighter</COREF> , called the F-14A, were plagued
with engine problems when <COREF ID='43' REF='X133'>they</COREF> entered the <COREF ID='44' REF='X135'>Navy</COREF> 's fleet of
carrier-based <COREF ID='X163'>jet fighters</COREF> in 1973. Specifically, <COREF ID='X162'>the engines</COREF> used
on <COREF ID='45' REF='40'>the first model</COREF> were not powerful enough for <COREF ID='46' REF='X163'>a fighter</COREF> of <COREF ID='47' REF='6'>its</COREF>
size.
The <COREF ID='48' REF='44'>Navy</COREF> was forced to impose strict restrictions on how pilots
could operate <COREF ID='49' REF='25'>the aircraft</COREF> , and had to replace many of <COREF ID='50' REF='X162'>the engines</COREF> .
Two of the three planes that have crashed since late January were <COREF ID='52' REF='X113'>F-14As</COREF> .
The engines installed in later models, <COREF ID='53' REF='X120'>the F-14B and the F-14D</COREF> ,
were more powerful and have proved more reliable. Despite the
troubles of <COREF ID='54' REF='53'>the F-14 fleet</COREF> , the rate of accidents among all <COREF ID='55' REF='48'>Navy</COREF>
<COREF ID='X202'>fighter planes</COREF> has come down dramatically in recent years, a record
that has made <COREF ID='56' REF='36'>the recent spate of crashes</COREF> all the more alarming.
In the first of <COREF ID='57' REF='56'>the crashes this year</COREF> , <COREF ID='X209'>an F-14A</COREF> crashed into a
residential neighborhood in Nashville, Tenn., on Jan. 29, <COREF ID='X216'>seconds</COREF>
after takeoff. The two-man crew was killed, along with three people
on the ground. The pilot was involved in <COREF ID='X227'>another <COREF ID='58' REF='X209'>F-14</COREF> crash</COREF> in
1995.
Last Sunday, the crew of <COREF ID='X231'>an F-14D</COREF> was killed when <COREF ID='59' REF='X202'>the fighter</COREF>
plunged into the Pacific off the coast of Southern California
during exercises. <COREF ID='60' REF='X231'>The F-14</COREF> that crashed on <COREF ID='90' REF='X42'>Thursday</COREF> had flown from <COREF ID='62' REF='50'>the Nimitz</COREF> ,
which is sailing in <COREF ID='63' REF='12'>the Persian Gulf</COREF> to enforce a no-fly zone over
southern Iraq, an operation that dates from the end of the 1991 war
in <COREF ID='64' REF='63'>the gulf</COREF> . <COREF ID='65' REF='55'>Navy officials</COREF> said that <COREF ID='67' REF='X202'>the plane</COREF> was on a routine
training mission. <COREF ID='68' REF='X216'>They</COREF> would not speculate on the cause of <COREF ID='69' REF='X227'>the crash</COREF> . <COREF ID='70' REF='67'>The plane</COREF> , which was manufacutred by the Grumman Corp. of Long
Island, has gone out of production, and the <COREF ID='71' REF='65'>Navy</COREF> has begun to phase
out <COREF ID='72' REF='70'>the plane</COREF> entirely, replacing <COREF ID='73' REF='X216'>it</COREF> with the F-18.
