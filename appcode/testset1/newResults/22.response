UNDATED: flight attendants.
Valujet, which had proclaimed <COREF ID='5' REF='5'>itself</COREF> <COREF ID='6' REF='6'>the fastest-growing airline in history</COREF> , said last month that <COREF ID='7' REF='5'>it</COREF> would buy fewer airplanes than <COREF ID='8' REF='5'>it</COREF> planned this year and would ``concentrate on <COREF ID='9' REF='7'>its</COREF> product
integrity'' in anticipation of the summer Olympic Games in Atlanta.
Last Jan. 12, <COREF ID='X29'>a</COREF> <COREF ID='10' REF='10'>Valujet</COREF> DC-9 with <COREF ID='X32'>30 people</COREF> aboard slid into a
snowbank after landing at Dulles International Airport outside
Washington, closing <COREF ID='11' REF='6'>the airport</COREF> for three hours.
On Jan. 26, another a <COREF ID='12' REF='10'>Valujet</COREF> DC-9 got stuck in the mud at
Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport and 101 passengers had to
be bused back to <COREF ID='13' REF='6'>the terminal</COREF> .
On Feb. 28, <COREF ID='X59'>another <COREF ID='14' REF='10'>Valujet</COREF> plane</COREF> ran off a runway in Savannah,
Ga. And on Mar. 19, an emergency chute inflated inside the cabin of
a Valujet plane in Tampa, Fla., slightly injuring <COREF ID='X67'>a flight</COREF>
attendant; the pilot had to crawl out a window, climb into the <COREF ID='16' REF='X59'>plane</COREF> through the tailcone and cut <COREF ID='17' REF='6'>the chute</COREF> with a knife to free <COREF ID='18' REF='6'>the attendant</COREF> .
Because of the inaccessibility of Saturday's <COREF ID='19' REF='19'>crash</COREF> site, few
details were available in the hours immediately after <COREF ID='90' REF='6'>the plane</COREF>
went down. In its statement, <COREF ID='21' REF='10'>Valujet</COREF> said that <COREF ID='22' REF='X67'>Flight 592</COREF> had left
<COREF ID='X92'>Miami</COREF> at about 2:15 p.m., <COREF ID='23' REF='X32'>more than 70 minutes</COREF> after its regularly
scheduled departure time. <COREF ID='25' REF='25'>It</COREF> said <COREF ID='26' REF='6'>the DC-9-32</COREF> , <COREF ID='27' REF='X29'>a McDonnell-Douglas plane</COREF> configured with
<COREF ID='X103'>seats</COREF> for 113 passengers, radioed at 2:25 p.m. that <COREF ID='28' REF='X103'>it</COREF> was returning to <COREF ID='29' REF='X92'>Miami</COREF> . <COREF ID='30' REF='6'>The Valujet statement</COREF> did not mention <COREF ID='X104'>smoke</COREF> in the cabin, but
other reports said the pilot had spoken to air-traffic controllers
of <COREF ID='32' REF='X104'>smoke</COREF> in <COREF ID='33' REF='6'>the cabin</COREF> . <COREF ID='34' REF='6'>The airline</COREF> quoted preliminary reports as saying <COREF ID='35' REF='6'>the plane</COREF> went
down about 20 miles northwest of <COREF ID='36' REF='X92'>Miami</COREF> ``in a dense area of the
Florida Everglades, making accessibility difficult.''
Three hours after <COREF ID='37' REF='6'>the crash</COREF> , the FAA reported that <COREF ID='38' REF='6'>the jet</COREF> had
been about 100 miles northwest of <COREF ID='39' REF='X92'>Miami</COREF> when <COREF ID='40' REF='6'>the pilot</COREF> reported <COREF ID='41' REF='X104'>smoke</COREF> in the cockpit, and that after turning around had gone about
80 miles before crashing.
The <COREF ID='42' REF='X29'>FAA</COREF> report said <COREF ID='43' REF='6'>the plane</COREF> had apparently gone into a steep
dive and exploded on impact.
A student pilot, <COREF ID='44' REF='44'>Rick DeLisle</COREF> , who was flying a small plane in
the area with an instructor, bound for Naples, Fla, told CNN of
witnessing <COREF ID='45' REF='6'>the crash</COREF> . After hearing <COREF ID='46' REF='9'>his instructor</COREF> yelling, <COREF ID='48' REF='44'>DeLisle</COREF>
said, `` <COREF ID='49' REF='48'>I</COREF> turned and saw an explosion.''
``There was <COREF ID='X166'>nothing</COREF> in <COREF ID='X168'>the sense</COREF> of fire,'' <COREF ID='50' REF='X168'>he</COREF> said. `` <COREF ID='51' REF='X166'>It</COREF> was
almost like what <COREF ID='52' REF='X168'>I</COREF> would call <COREF ID='53' REF='X29'>a mushroom cloud</COREF> . <COREF ID='54' REF='52'>It</COREF> went up 100
feet.'' <COREF ID='55' REF='44'>DeLisle</COREF> said he and his instructor flew closer and examined the
<COREF ID='X182'>ground</COREF> with binoculars. `` <COREF ID='59' REF='X182'>We</COREF> got down to about 200 feet or so, and
with <COREF ID='60' REF='6'>the binocs</COREF> it looked like <COREF ID='61' REF='X29'>a large trash bag worth of debris</COREF> .''
As word of <COREF ID='62' REF='6'>the crash</COREF> was flashed over news reports, relatives of
people who had been on board went to Miami International Airport,
seeking information on what had happened.
Hernando Vergera, <COREF ID='63' REF='6'>an airport spokesman</COREF> , said the Office of Dade
<COREF ID='X216'>County Aviation</COREF> was bringing counselors to meet with <COREF ID='65' REF='65'>family members</COREF> , about 50 of whom were at the airport. <COREF ID='66' REF='X216'>They</COREF> were being
taken to an undisclosed location for privacy, <COREF ID='67' REF='67'>Vergera</COREF> said. <COREF ID='68' REF='10'>Valujet</COREF> personnel at <COREF ID='69' REF='6'>the airport</COREF> declined to comment, and had
minimal contact with <COREF ID='70' REF='6'>the families of the victims</COREF> , <COREF ID='71' REF='67'>Vergera</COREF> said. <COREF ID='72' REF='10'>Valujet</COREF> did not immediately return telephone messages.
The Coast Guard told The Associated Press that rescue aircraft
were helping to look for wreckage and survivors. But all that
rescue pilots could detect was scorched earth, Petty Officer Angela
Weeks said.
