STRATFORD, <COREF ID='X23'>Conn.</COREF> @amp;MD; <COREF ID='5' REF='4'>A helicopter</COREF> making a test flight before <COREF ID='6' REF='X23'>it</COREF>
was to be delivered to <COREF ID='X31'>the Marine Corps</COREF> to provide cargo service
for <COREF ID='X34'>the White House</COREF> appeared to lose <COREF ID='X32'>its rotors</COREF> on Thursday and
crashed onto the flight <COREF ID='X35'>field</COREF> of the Sikorsky Aircraft Corp.,
killing <COREF ID='8' REF='6'>all four crew members</COREF> .
Hovering at the height of the nearby Sikorsky Bridge, where <COREF ID='X43'>the</COREF>
Merritt Parkway crosses the Housatonic River, <COREF ID='9' REF='5'>the CH53E helicopter</COREF>
@amp;MD; also known as <COREF ID='10' REF='X31'>the Super Stallion</COREF> for <COREF ID='11' REF='X32'>its</COREF> size and power @amp;MD;
appeared to be in distress, <COREF ID='X60'>witnesses</COREF> said, with <COREF ID='X58'>smoke</COREF> issuing from <COREF ID='12' REF='11'>it</COREF> before <COREF ID='13' REF='11'>its 40-foot rotors</COREF> broke off.
`` <COREF ID='15' REF='9'>The helicopter</COREF> was up in the air; it's normal for us to see <COREF ID='16' REF='X58'>them</COREF> ,'' said John Nasufi, who spotted <COREF ID='17' REF='X60'>it</COREF> as <COREF ID='18' REF='X60'>he</COREF> was loading <COREF ID='X68'>pizzas</COREF>
from <COREF ID='19' REF='X58'>his</COREF> restaurant above <COREF ID='20' REF='19'>the river</COREF> for a lunchtime delivery to the <COREF ID='21' REF='X43'>Sikorsky</COREF> workers. `` <COREF ID='22' REF='15'>The helicopter</COREF> had <COREF ID='23' REF='X58'>smoke</COREF> coming out, and all of
a sudden <COREF ID='24' REF='X68'>it</COREF> lost <COREF ID='25' REF='13'>its blades</COREF> , and that was it. <COREF ID='27' REF='X68'>It</COREF> came straight
down.''
The explosion shook nearby buildings and stopped traffic on the <COREF ID='28' REF='X43'>bridge</COREF> , from which the crushed fuselage could be seen burning on <COREF ID='29' REF='19'>the tarmac</COREF> less than half a mile away, about 50 feet from the <COREF ID='30' REF='20'>river</COREF> . <COREF ID='31' REF='22'>The craft's distress</COREF> had lasted long enough for <COREF ID='X94'>one driver</COREF>
to call a Bridgeport radio station to report that <COREF ID='33' REF='22'>a helicopter</COREF> was
in <COREF ID='34' REF='19'>trouble</COREF> . <COREF ID='35' REF='21'>Sikorsky</COREF> officials said <COREF ID='36' REF='X94'>all four peole on board</COREF> were <COREF ID='37' REF='27'>employees</COREF> . <COREF ID='38' REF='37'>Their</COREF> names were withheld until relatives could be notified.
A spokeswoman for Sikorsky, <COREF ID='40' REF='19'>Gina McAllister</COREF> , said <COREF ID='41' REF='33'>the heavy-lift helicopter</COREF> , which can carry a payload of 31 tons, was to be
assigned to the <COREF ID='42' REF='X31'>Marine</COREF> base at Quantico, Va. <COREF ID='43' REF='41'>The helicopter</COREF> would
have been used to ferry <COREF ID='X131'>limousines</COREF> and other advance equipment for
the <COREF ID='44' REF='X34'>White House</COREF> . <COREF ID='45' REF='X131'>She</COREF> said <COREF ID='46' REF='X131'>it</COREF> would not have carried the president. <COREF ID='47' REF='43'>The crash</COREF> occurred at 11:08 a.m. <COREF ID='48' REF='X60'>Witnesses</COREF> differed as to
whether <COREF ID='49' REF='19'>the craft</COREF> had burst into flames before <COREF ID='50' REF='48'>it</COREF> dropped onto <COREF ID='51' REF='X35'>the flight field</COREF> , or upon impact. But many said that before <COREF ID='52' REF='49'>the craft</COREF>
fell, <COREF ID='53' REF='25'>its three rotor blades</COREF> shot off. One landed across the <COREF ID='55' REF='30'>Housatonic River</COREF> , which borders the <COREF ID='56' REF='35'>Sikorsky</COREF> property, one flew
toward <COREF ID='57' REF='56'>the Sikorsky Bridge</COREF> , and the third fell toward the assembly
plant. <COREF ID='58' REF='40'>Ms. McAllister</COREF> said the cause of <COREF ID='59' REF='47'>the crash</COREF> was not known. With
the approval of the Federal Aviation Administration and the
National Transportation Safety Board, <COREF ID='X171'>she</COREF> said, <COREF ID='60' REF='57'>Sikorsky Aircraft</COREF>
would conduct the safety investigation with the participation of
the Navy Safety Center.
The <COREF ID='61' REF='42'>Marine Corps</COREF> and the Navy have purchased 150 of the
heavy-lift helicopters, which can be used for amphibious assaults,
carrying cargo and recovering aircraft, according to Jane's All the
World's Aircraft. <COREF ID='62' REF='X171'>CH53E's</COREF> were used to rescue Air Force Capt. Scott
O'Grady when <COREF ID='63' REF='62'>he</COREF> was shot down over Bosnia, and to evacuate the U.S.
embassy in Somalia, <COREF ID='64' REF='58'>Ms. McAllister</COREF> said.
`` <COREF ID='65' REF='43'>This helicopter</COREF> has a very proud tradition, and the <COREF ID='66' REF='60'>Sikorsky</COREF>
family is devastated by <COREF ID='67' REF='65'>this mishap</COREF> ,'' <COREF ID='68' REF='62'>she</COREF> said.
