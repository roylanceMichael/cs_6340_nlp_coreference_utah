WASHINGTON @amp;MD; <COREF ID='X23'>The <COREF ID='3' REF='X23'>Navy</COREF> suspended operations</COREF> for <COREF ID='4' REF='3'>its</COREF> entire fleet
of <COREF ID='X32'>F-14 airplanes</COREF> <COREF ID='X29'>Thursday</COREF> after <COREF ID='6' REF='X11'>the third ``Tomcat'' crash in a month</COREF> @amp;MD; <COREF ID='8' REF='X32'>the second in a week</COREF> .
The 72-hour ``safety stand-down'' came shortly after an F-14
<COREF ID='X41'>fighter</COREF> from the USS Nimitz crashed during flight operations in the
northern Persian Gulf at about 6:30 a.m. EST.
The <COREF ID='10' REF='3'>Navy</COREF> announced that <COREF ID='X52'>the two Naval aviators</COREF> on <COREF ID='X50'>board</COREF> were
rescued by a SH-60 helicopter after <COREF ID='11' REF='X50'>they</COREF> ejected from <COREF ID='12' REF='11'>the aircraft</COREF> .
The <COREF ID='13' REF='10'>Navy</COREF> said that <COREF ID='14' REF='11'>both men</COREF> were in good condition. One aviator
suffered minor abrasions. The <COREF ID='15' REF='13'>Navy</COREF> is investigating the cause.
<COREF ID='X66'>Another Tomcat</COREF> crashed off the coast of California during
exercises on <COREF ID='X72'>the aircraft carrier</COREF> Carl Vinson on Sunday. Both crew
members were killed. Late last month, <COREF ID='X76'>an F-14</COREF> crashed near
Nashville, killing both crew members and three civilians on the
ground.
Although <COREF ID='16' REF='6'>the crash</COREF> <COREF ID='17' REF='X29'>Thursday</COREF> was <COREF ID='18' REF='X66'>the third Tomcat crash</COREF> <COREF ID='X87'>this</COREF>
year, <COREF ID='X94'>Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon</COREF> said the <COREF ID='22' REF='15'>Navy</COREF> had
uncovered no evidence of a flaw in <COREF ID='23' REF='X72'>the aircraft</COREF> .
<COREF ID='X104'>A safety stand-down</COREF> is <COREF ID='24' REF='X52'>a procedure the military uses to conduct an intensive review</COREF> . During <COREF ID='25' REF='X87'>this three-day period</COREF> , the three
classes of <COREF ID='27' REF='X76'>F-14s</COREF> will stay out of the air so <COREF ID='28' REF='22'>Navy</COREF> personnel can
review maintenance procedures and equipment, plus check each
<COREF ID='X121'>aircraft</COREF> for weaknesses or deficiencies.
<COREF ID='X125'>The F-14s</COREF> on the deck of the USS America will be allowed to fly
off because <COREF ID='29' REF='X121'>the aircraft carrier</COREF> is returning from a deployment.
Carrier decks are routinely cleared of <COREF ID='X132'>aircraft</COREF> the day before the <COREF ID='30' REF='29'>carrier</COREF> docks.
``We do not know what has caused these three crashes this
year,'' <COREF ID='33' REF='X94'>Bacon</COREF> said. ``The goal of <COREF ID='34' REF='X104'>the stand-down</COREF> is to take <COREF ID='X142'>a time</COREF>
out to look at everything involved with <COREF ID='35' REF='X125'>the F-14s</COREF> .
Adm. Jeremy Boorda, <COREF ID='36' REF='X52'>the chief of Naval Operations</COREF> , informed
Deputy Defense Secretary John White of <COREF ID='38' REF='16'>the latest crash</COREF> <COREF ID='39' REF='17'>Thursday</COREF>
morning and told <COREF ID='40' REF='36'>him</COREF> <COREF ID='41' REF='36'>he</COREF> was ordering <COREF ID='42' REF='34'>the standdown</COREF> for <COREF ID='43' REF='X132'>the entire fleet of more than 300 aircraft</COREF> , <COREF ID='45' REF='33'>Bacon</COREF> said.
``What the <COREF ID='46' REF='28'>Navy</COREF> is trying to do is find out what caused <COREF ID='47' REF='41'>these accidents</COREF> ,'' <COREF ID='48' REF='45'>Bacon</COREF> said.
In the past five years, 32 F-14s have crashed. One of <COREF ID='X178'>the</COREF>
Navy's first female pilots, <COREF ID='50' REF='X178'>Lt. Kara Hultgren</COREF> , died while trying to
land <COREF ID='X186'>an F-14</COREF> on <COREF ID='X189'>an aircraft</COREF> carrier in 1994. <COREF ID='X191'>The <COREF ID='51' REF='46'>Navy</COREF> concluded</COREF>
that engine failure caused that crash. <COREF ID='52' REF='X191'>The Tomcat</COREF> , <COREF ID='53' REF='X189'>a $38 million, twin-engine aircraft</COREF> built by the
Grumman Aerospace Corp., is <COREF ID='54' REF='X41'>the standard fighter plane</COREF> used by the
<COREF ID='X208'>Navy</COREF> for close-in air combat. <COREF ID='56' REF='52'>The aircraft</COREF> has been in operation
since 1973. The oldest version of the aircraft, <COREF ID='58' REF='X186'>the F-14A</COREF> , is
scheduled to be phased out by the year 2004.
<COREF ID='X225'>The crash rate</COREF> for <COREF ID='59' REF='58'>the F-14</COREF> dropped dramatically after the
initial years of deployment and has generally gone down since <COREF ID='60' REF='X225'>then</COREF>
except for occasional spurts of accidents, according to Naval
records. <COREF ID='61' REF='48'>Bacon</COREF> said the <COREF ID='62' REF='X208'>Navy</COREF> had no single explanation for the increases
in <COREF ID='63' REF='59'>F-14</COREF> accidents.
``The <COREF ID='64' REF='62'>Navy</COREF> informs <COREF ID='65' REF='X142'>me</COREF> that <COREF ID='66' REF='65'>they</COREF> have been unable to find a
common thread to <COREF ID='67' REF='47'>these accidents</COREF> ,'' <COREF ID='68' REF='61'>Bacon</COREF> said. ``This is <COREF ID='69' REF='67'>a mystery</COREF> .''
