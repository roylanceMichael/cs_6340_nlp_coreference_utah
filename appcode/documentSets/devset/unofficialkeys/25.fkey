 <COREF ID="X1">Eastern Pilots</COREF> Win Round
@  In <COREF ID="X2">Battle Over Back Pay</COREF>

 NEW YORK  


 <COREF ID="3" REF="X1">Eastern Airlines pilots</COREF> won a round in <COREF ID="X3">bankruptcy court</COREF> that <COREF ID="6" REF="3">they</COREF> say could bring <COREF ID="7" REF="6">them</COREF> as much as $250 million in back pay, but an arbitrator must decide how much -- if anything -- <COREF ID="9" REF="7">they</COREF> are owed. 


 The decision by <COREF ID="X4">Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland</COREF> in New York will allow <COREF ID="X5">the Air Line Pilots Association</COREF> to go forward with <COREF ID="X6">a claim</COREF> that a "pay parity" clause in their contract was triggered when another <COREF ID="X9">Eastern</COREF> union received a pay raise. 


 All legal proceedings against <COREF ID="18" REF="X9">Eastern</COREF>, a unit of <COREF ID="X10">Texas Air Corp.</COREF>, were put on hold when <COREF ID="20" REF="18">Eastern</COREF> filed for <COREF ID="51" REF="X3">bankruptcy-law</COREF> protection March 9. 
 But <COREF ID="22" REF="X4">Judge Lifland</COREF> lifted that stay to let <COREF ID="23" REF="X6">the three-year-old back-pay claim</COREF> go to <COREF ID="X8">arbitration</COREF>, provided <COREF ID="25" REF="X8">that process</COREF> is swift. 
 If <COREF ID="26" REF="25">it</COREF> doesn't go quickly enough, <COREF ID="27" REF="22">the judge</COREF> said <COREF ID="28" REF="27">he</COREF> may invoke a provision of <COREF ID="29" REF="51">the bankruptcy code</COREF> that would let <COREF ID="31" REF="28">him</COREF> estimate what <COREF ID="32" REF="9">pilots</COREF> are owed. 
 <COREF ID="33" REF="26">The arbitration</COREF> is scheduled to begin Aug. 9. 


 At issue is <COREF ID="34" REF="X2">a three-year-old effort</COREF> by the pilots to prove they had a valid contract in 1986, and that Eastern violated a clause in it that would give them raises if any other group got raises. 
 Shortly after <COREF ID="50" REF="X10">Texas Air</COREF> took over <COREF ID="45" REF="20">Eastern</COREF>, management supervisors for the machinists' union received a 20% pay raise. 


 <COREF ID="48" REF="32">The pilots</COREF> have won two rounds of <COREF ID="49" REF="34">this battle</COREF> in federal court, with federal district court and an appeals court deciding that the pilots' contract was valid. 
 Neither court, however, ruled on the merits of <COREF ID="52" REF="23">their claim</COREF>.
