<COREF ID='5' REF='X12'>The rise in labor costs and wage settlements</COREF> , which has been narrowing for most of the decade, leveled off <COREF ID='11' REF='X5'>last year</COREF> , <COREF ID='X20'>the Labor Department</COREF> said.
<COREF ID='X30'>Total compensation costs</COREF> in private industry, including pay and benefits, rose 3.3% <COREF ID='13' REF='11'>last year</COREF> after a 3.2% increase in 1986, <COREF ID='14' REF='X20'>the department</COREF> said.
The increase in <COREF ID='15' REF='X30'>these costs</COREF> had been getting smaller each year since 1981, when <COREF ID='16' REF='15'>they</COREF> rose 9.8%, <COREF ID='17' REF='5'>the same as in 1980</COREF> .
Meanwhile, collective bargaining agreements reached <COREF ID='X46'>last year</COREF> called for an average 2.2% wage increase in <COREF ID='X48'>the first year</COREF> of the contract and 2.1% annually over the life of the pact.
The industries surveyed agreed to <COREF ID='X60'>the same percentage pay</COREF> raises when they last reached contract accords, <COREF ID='26' REF='14'>the department</COREF> said.
<COREF ID='X64'>Officials</COREF> said <COREF ID='27' REF='X60'>it</COREF> 's <COREF ID='28' REF='X48'>the first time</COREF> since 1982 that <COREF ID='X68'>current contract settlements</COREF> didn't provide <COREF ID='X69'>lower average wage adjustments</COREF> than the bargaining agreements <COREF ID='X63'>they</COREF> replaced.
The <COREF ID='34' REF='X69'>wage</COREF> agreements reached <COREF ID='35' REF='X46'>last year</COREF> also were higher than the average <COREF ID='36' REF='X60'>pay</COREF> rises bargained in <COREF ID='37' REF='36'>1986</COREF> , when a 1.2% increase in the first contract year and a 1.8% annual increase during <COREF ID='40' REF='X68'>the life of the settlements</COREF> were <COREF ID='X80'>the smallest increases</COREF> recorded during the 20 years <COREF ID='43' REF='26'>the Labor Department</COREF> has collected the statistics.
<COREF ID='44' REF='X64'>Department officials</COREF> said <COREF ID='46' REF='X80'>this year's higher wage increases</COREF> don't necessarily indicate a trend.
A tighter labor market in the services sector may be part of the reason the compensation increases have leveled off, <COREF ID='50' REF='44'>officials</COREF> said.
A tighter <COREF ID='51' REF='X12'>labor</COREF> market would allow employees to demand higher pay and benefits.
In its report on major collective bargaining agreements, <COREF ID='53' REF='43'>the department</COREF> said that the average increase was reduced by lump-sum payments, which are <COREF ID='X113'>one-time payments</COREF> often made upon a contract's ratification.
<COREF ID='56' REF='X113'>The payments</COREF> often are provided instead of <COREF ID='57' REF='34'>wage</COREF> increases, but <COREF ID='58' REF='X63'>they</COREF> aren't included in <COREF ID='59' REF='34'>wages</COREF> and aren't used as a base for future increases.
About half of the workers covered by big <COREF ID='60' REF='51'>labor</COREF> contracts <COREF ID='61' REF='35'>last year</COREF> received <COREF ID='62' REF='56'>these payments</COREF> .
Better-than-average <COREF ID='63' REF='57'>wage</COREF> settlements for <COREF ID='X136'>construction industry workers</COREF> -- specifically those in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern regions -- were largely responsible for stopping the narrowing trend.
<COREF ID='64' REF='X136'>Construction</COREF> pacts settled in <COREF ID='65' REF='64'>1987</COREF> averaged 2.9% increases in <COREF ID='X146'>the first contract year</COREF> and 3.1% annually.
All other industries surveyed <COREF ID='68' REF='X146'>last year</COREF> , including the automobile, food store and steel industries, averaged 2.1% increases in <COREF ID='69' REF='X146'>the first contract year</COREF> and 1.9% annually.
About two million workers were covered by <COREF ID='71' REF='68'>agreements reached last year</COREF> .</TXT>
