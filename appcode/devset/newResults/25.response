NEW YORK
<COREF ID='3' REF='X4'>Eastern Airlines pilots</COREF> won a round in <COREF ID='X26'>bankruptcy court</COREF> that <COREF ID='6' REF='X16'>they</COREF> say could bring <COREF ID='7' REF='X16'>them</COREF> as much as $250 million in back pay, but an arbitrator must decide how much -- if anything -- <COREF ID='9' REF='6'>they</COREF> are owed.
<COREF ID='X32'>The decision</COREF> by <COREF ID='X37'>Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland</COREF> in New York will allow <COREF ID='X36'>the Air Line Pilots Association</COREF> to go forward with <COREF ID='X30'>a claim</COREF> that a "pay parity" clause in their contract was triggered when another Eastern union received a pay raise.
All legal proceedings against Eastern, a unit of Texas Air Corp., were put on hold when <COREF ID='20' REF='X4'>Eastern</COREF> filed for bankruptcy-law protection March 9.
But <COREF ID='22' REF='X37'>Judge Lifland</COREF> lifted that stay to let <COREF ID='23' REF='X30'>the three-year-old back-pay claim</COREF> go to arbitration, provided <COREF ID='25' REF='23'>that process</COREF> is swift.
If <COREF ID='26' REF='9'>it</COREF> doesn't go quickly enough, <COREF ID='27' REF='X37'>the judge</COREF> said <COREF ID='28' REF='9'>he</COREF> may invoke a provision of <COREF ID='29' REF='X26'>the bankruptcy code</COREF> that would let <COREF ID='31' REF='9'>him</COREF> estimate what <COREF ID='32' REF='X4'>pilots</COREF> are owed.
<COREF ID='33' REF='X32'>The arbitration</COREF> is scheduled to begin Aug. 9.
At issue is <COREF ID='34' REF='23'>a three-year-old effort</COREF> by the pilots to prove they had a valid contract in 1986, and that Eastern violated a clause in it that would give them raises if any other group got raises.
Shortly after <COREF ID='50' REF='X36'>Texas Air</COREF> took over <COREF ID='45' REF='X4'>Eastern</COREF> , management supervisors for the machinists' union received a 20% pay raise.
<COREF ID='48' REF='X4'>The pilots</COREF> have won two rounds of <COREF ID='49' REF='X5'>this battle</COREF> in federal court, with federal district court and an appeals court deciding that the pilots' contract was valid.
Neither court, however, ruled on the merits of <COREF ID='52' REF='X30'>their claim</COREF> .</TXT>
