<COREF ID='2' REF='X3'>President Reagan</COREF> acknowledged that <COREF ID='X11'>there</COREF> is little chance <COREF ID='3' REF='X11'>he</COREF> and <COREF ID='X19'>Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev</COREF> will sign <COREF ID='4' REF='X5'>a strategic arms agreement</COREF> at <COREF ID='26' REF='X4'>their summit</COREF> in Moscow later this month.
In answering <COREF ID='X24'>questions</COREF> from members of the National Strategy Forum <COREF ID='7' REF='X11'>here</COREF> , <COREF ID='8' REF='2'>Mr. Reagan</COREF> said <COREF ID='X20'>it</COREF> is "doubtful" that a strategic arms reduction, or START, treaty could be wrapped up in time.
Administration aides have been saying for <COREF ID='X30'>weeks</COREF> that <COREF ID='X31'>there</COREF> are far too many disagreements remaining for <COREF ID='11' REF='X24'>a treaty</COREF> to be wrapped up, but <COREF ID='12' REF='8'>Mr. Reagan</COREF> 's remarks represented <COREF ID='13' REF='12'>his</COREF> bluntest public assessment so far.
<COREF ID='14' REF='12'>Mr. Reagan</COREF> said that both <COREF ID='15' REF='X31'>he</COREF> and <COREF ID='16' REF='X19'>Mr. Gorbachev</COREF> hope that an agreement eliminating intermediate-range nuclear missiles, signed at a summit meeting in Washington last December, will be ratified by <COREF ID='X43'>the Senate</COREF> in time for <COREF ID='19' REF='26'>the Moscow summit</COREF> .
But then <COREF ID='21' REF='X43'>he</COREF> added: "Our desire that <COREF ID='23' REF='X30'>we</COREF> would be able to sign <COREF ID='24' REF='11'>a START treaty</COREF> at <COREF ID='25' REF='19'>this Moscow summit</COREF> , as <COREF ID='27' REF='X30'>we</COREF> did <COREF ID='28' REF='19'>the other one at the Washington summit</COREF> , may not happen."
<COREF ID='31' REF='14'>Mr. Reagan</COREF> insisted that if such a treaty is ever completed, <COREF ID='32' REF='X20'>it</COREF> would have to produce "parity" in U.S. and Soviet strategic arsenals.</TXT>
