As <COREF ID='X20'>senior director</COREF> of UAL, and a member of <COREF ID='X22'>the executive committee</COREF> of its board, <COREF ID='3' REF='X22'>I</COREF> am appalled at the inaccuracies and anti-management bias in the Journal's April 17 article about Richard Ferris, <COREF ID='6' REF='X6'>UAL's chief executive officer</COREF> .
<COREF ID='8' REF='X6'>The UAL board</COREF> is four-square behind <COREF ID='10' REF='10'>Mr. Ferris</COREF> , <COREF ID='11' REF='10'>his</COREF> management team and <COREF ID='12' REF='11'>his</COREF> long-range strategy of making <COREF ID='X33'>United</COREF> a more competitive airline by combining <COREF ID='14' REF='8'>it</COREF> with <COREF ID='X39'>the premier hotel company</COREF> and car rental company.
Contrary to what <COREF ID='15' REF='X4'>the Journal article</COREF> suggests, board members have not been dissatisfied with the financial performance of <COREF ID='18' REF='X39'>Westin Hotels</COREF> and <COREF ID='19' REF='19'>Hertz</COREF> .
Like <COREF ID='20' REF='10'>Mr. Ferris</COREF> , <COREF ID='21' REF='X20'>the directors</COREF> have been dissatisfied with <COREF ID='X51'>the earnings</COREF> of United Airlines.
<COREF ID='23' REF='X51'>We</COREF> share <COREF ID='24' REF='23'>his</COREF> determination to improve <COREF ID='25' REF='24'>them</COREF> .
But <COREF ID='26' REF='25'>we</COREF> recognize that fare wars begun by <COREF ID='X62'>non-union airline competitors</COREF> have been responsible for a large part of <COREF ID='27' REF='X62'>our</COREF> difficulties.
<COREF ID='28' REF='10'>Mr. Ferris</COREF> and Jim Hartigan, <COREF ID='29' REF='X33'>president of United</COREF> , are taking steps to improve <COREF ID='31' REF='3'>its earnings</COREF> .
First-quarter financial results of <COREF ID='33' REF='X8'>the airline</COREF> should show a substantial improvement over comparable 1986 results, raising the prospect of a much better year-over-year financial performance in 1987.
Contrary to the implication in <COREF ID='34' REF='15'>your article</COREF> , the fact that the outside directors have employed <COREF ID='X96'>independent legal and financial counsel</COREF> in response to the pilots' proposal to purchase <COREF ID='36' REF='X33'>United</COREF> does not bespeak a lack of confidence in <COREF ID='37' REF='10'>Mr. Ferris</COREF> .
The employment of <COREF ID='38' REF='X96'>independent counsel</COREF> by outside directors is standard procedure in proposed corporate buyout situations.
The Journal's reference to Donald Trump's reputed desire to cause <COREF ID='X110'>the breakup</COREF> of <COREF ID='40' REF='X6'>UAL</COREF> so that <COREF ID='41' REF='X110'>he</COREF> can own the Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles ignores an important fact: <COREF ID='42' REF='X6'>UAL</COREF> does not own <COREF ID='43' REF='X22'>the Century Plaza</COREF> .
Most unfair and inaccurate was <COREF ID='44' REF='X4'>the Journal</COREF> 's reference to the case of the "570 newly hired pilots" whom United "tried to fire" because they "refused to cross picket lines."
<COREF ID='48' REF='X22'>These</COREF> are <COREF ID='49' REF='49'>pilots</COREF> who in 1985 were offered and accepted pre-hiring training with the knowledge they would be expected to fly if United's service were to be disrupted by a strike later that year.
When the pilots' strike occurred, <COREF ID='56' REF='X22'>the trainees</COREF> declined to cross the picket line; thus, <COREF ID='58' REF='X33'>United</COREF> declined to hire <COREF ID='59' REF='58'>them</COREF> .
In litigation that arose out of <COREF ID='60' REF='X22'>the strike</COREF> , <COREF ID='X156'>a federal district court</COREF> ruled that <COREF ID='61' REF='X22'>the 570 individuals</COREF> must be hired by <COREF ID='62' REF='X33'>United</COREF> , and <COREF ID='63' REF='X156'>they</COREF> have been flying in <COREF ID='64' REF='X33'>United</COREF> cockpits ever since.
Recently, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a circuit court reversal of <COREF ID='65' REF='X22'>the district court</COREF> , and held that <COREF ID='66' REF='X33'>United</COREF> was not required to hire <COREF ID='67' REF='X22'>the 570 pilots</COREF> .
However, in an effort to let <COREF ID='X168'>bygones</COREF> be bygones, <COREF ID='68' REF='X33'>United</COREF> management declined to take advantage of <COREF ID='69' REF='3'>its</COREF> court victory, and <COREF ID='70' REF='X168'>it</COREF> retained <COREF ID='71' REF='X22'>the 570 pilots</COREF> with <COREF ID='X170'>seniority</COREF> dating from 1985 when <COREF ID='73' REF='X170'>they</COREF> actually began flying for <COREF ID='74' REF='X33'>United</COREF> .
Neither <COREF ID='75' REF='10'>Mr. Ferris</COREF> nor <COREF ID='76' REF='X20'>the board of directors</COREF> has any desire to "break" the pilots' union.
If <COREF ID='X189'>harsh things</COREF> were said by either side in the heat of <COREF ID='78' REF='X22'>the 1985 pilot strike</COREF> , or since, we regret <COREF ID='81' REF='X189'>them</COREF> , and want to forget <COREF ID='82' REF='X189'>them</COREF> .
<COREF ID='83' REF='X189'>We</COREF> like and admire <COREF ID='84' REF='27'>our pilots</COREF> , who are <COREF ID='X195'>the best</COREF> in the business, and <COREF ID='85' REF='X195'>we</COREF> respect <COREF ID='86' REF='X195'>their</COREF> right to have a strong union.
<COREF ID='87' REF='X195'>We</COREF> are sure that, likewise, <COREF ID='88' REF='87'>they</COREF> want <COREF ID='89' REF='88'>us</COREF> to do <COREF ID='90' REF='89'>our</COREF> best to keep <COREF ID='91' REF='X33'>United</COREF> a strong and prosperous employer. <COREF ID='92' REF='29'>Charled F. Luce</COREF>
