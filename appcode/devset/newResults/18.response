<COREF ID='X2'>U.S. Mediator</COREF> Says Eastern Negotiations Are Progressing and Near Critical Stage

After months of quiet and productive meetings, <COREF ID='X12'>negotiators</COREF> in <COREF ID='X16'>the bitter labor battle</COREF> at <COREF ID='X13'>Eastern Airlines</COREF> are approaching a critical phase in <COREF ID='3' REF='X9'>the talks</COREF> , <COREF ID='4' REF='X2'>a federal mediator</COREF> said.
<COREF ID='5' REF='X12'>Harry Bickford</COREF> , who has been supervising <COREF ID='X25'>the talks</COREF> in Miami, since last fall, said that <COREF ID='8' REF='5'>representatives</COREF> of the company and <COREF ID='X35'>the International Association</COREF> of Machinists have been meeting almost daily since January and have resolved hundreds of differences.
"We are down to the point that within a short time <COREF ID='11' REF='X35'>we</COREF> will be coming to terms with the gut issues," <COREF ID='12' REF='X25'>he</COREF> said.
<COREF ID='13' REF='5'>Mr. Bickford</COREF> 's comments are the first indication that progress has occurred in <COREF ID='14' REF='X16'>the high-stakes, 16-month confrontation over labor costs</COREF> .
Eastern, a unit of Texas Air Corp., is seeking steep wage cuts from <COREF ID='X73'>its roughly 10,000 machinists</COREF> and baggage handlers as part of a plan to restore <COREF ID='18' REF='12'>the ailing carrier</COREF> to profitability, and <COREF ID='19' REF='X73'>it</COREF> has shrunk <COREF ID='20' REF='19'>its</COREF> capacity about 13% in the past year while seeking <COREF ID='21' REF='14'>the cost concessions</COREF> .
In an interview, <COREF ID='22' REF='13'>Mr. Bickford</COREF> acknowledged that the ever-growing clamor of public demonstrations, <COREF ID='X84'>letter-writing campaigns</COREF> and political lobbying have heightened antagonism at the bargaining table.
"Litigation, charges, <COREF ID='X92'>counter-charges</COREF> -- <COREF ID='23' REF='X84'>I</COREF> 'm used to that," said <COREF ID='24' REF='22'>Mr. Bickford, an 18-year mediation veteran</COREF> .
"But the extent to which <COREF ID='25' REF='19'>it</COREF> has gone in this case is unparalleled.
<COREF ID='26' REF='X92'>I</COREF> have never faced anything like <COREF ID='27' REF='25'>it</COREF> ."
Nevertheless, <COREF ID='28' REF='X92'>"We</COREF> are still talking," <COREF ID='29' REF='24'>Mr. Bickford</COREF> asserted, "and have been every day since the 26th of January, with the exception of three periods totaling 10 days."
<COREF ID='30' REF='29'>Mr. Bickford</COREF> expressed anger at the growing perception that <COREF ID='X117'>the mediation process</COREF> was fruitless and futile.
Last week, for instance, <COREF ID='X127'>Florida Gov. Bob Martinez</COREF> issued a news release saying that " <COREF ID='31' REF='X117'>mediation</COREF> has reached a stalemate and <COREF ID='X123'>both sides</COREF> should be allowed to return to <COREF ID='32' REF='12'>the bargaining table</COREF> ."
And for <COREF ID='33' REF='X123'>their</COREF> part, <COREF ID='34' REF='X13'>Eastern</COREF> officials continue to lobby for the National Mediation Board to impose a deadline on <COREF ID='35' REF='X25'>the talks</COREF> , without which management contends an agreement on a wage-concession package is all but impossible.
Under U.S. labor law applying to airlines, the mediator may declare an impasse and begin a 30-day countdown, after which <COREF ID='X141'>management</COREF> may unilaterally impose <COREF ID='37' REF='20'>its</COREF> last contract offer and <COREF ID='X139'>the union</COREF> is free to strike.
"I don't believe there is any prospect of getting <COREF ID='38' REF='37'>a negotiated settlement</COREF> ," said <COREF ID='39' REF='38'>Phil Bakes</COREF> , <COREF ID='40' REF='34'>president and chief executive officer of Eastern</COREF> , "until there is a firm date when the existing contract comes to an end."
<COREF ID='43' REF='X139'>The union</COREF> says that <COREF ID='44' REF='27'>it</COREF> is bargaining seriously and that each side has made concessions.
<COREF ID='45' REF='38'>A settlement through mediation</COREF> is possible, "absolutely," said Charles Bryan, <COREF ID='46' REF='43'>head of the machinists' union at Eastern</COREF> .
" <COREF ID='49' REF='37'>I</COREF> have never called <COREF ID='X181'>a strike</COREF> at <COREF ID='50' REF='46'>Eastern</COREF> ," <COREF ID='51' REF='35'>he</COREF> said.
Indeed, <COREF ID='52' REF='46'>the Machinists union</COREF> -- as well as the pilot and flight attendant unions at <COREF ID='53' REF='50'>Eastern</COREF> , from whom <COREF ID='54' REF='X141'>management</COREF> will also seek concessions in the coming months -- is anxious to avoid <COREF ID='55' REF='X181'>a strike</COREF> .
<COREF ID='56' REF='53'>Eastern</COREF> has made elaborate preparations to keep <COREF ID='57' REF='X13'>the airline</COREF> flying with non-union workers.
Even as <COREF ID='58' REF='35'>talks</COREF> continue under <COREF ID='59' REF='30'>Mr. Bickford</COREF> , neither side shows any sign of relenting in public.
Last week, <COREF ID='60' REF='56'>Eastern</COREF> ran newspaper advertising featuring Frank Borman, <COREF ID='61' REF='56'>the former astronaut and former Eastern president</COREF> , saying the federal investigation of <COREF ID='X205'>Texas Air</COREF> resulted from a union "whisper campaign" alleging <COREF ID='65' REF='57'>the airline</COREF> is unsafe.
A week earlier, <COREF ID='66' REF='60'>Eastern</COREF> sued the <COREF ID='67' REF='52'>Machinist</COREF> and <COREF ID='68' REF='52'>pilot unions</COREF> , accusing <COREF ID='69' REF='67'>them</COREF> of a criminal conspiracy to drive down <COREF ID='70' REF='X205'>Texas Air</COREF> 's stock price.
<COREF ID='71' REF='66'>Eastern</COREF> and <COREF ID='72' REF='70'>Texas Air</COREF> are also urging employees and shareholders to write <COREF ID='X229'>their members</COREF> of Congress demanding that <COREF ID='73' REF='45'>the National Mediation Board</COREF> begin the 30-day countdown in <COREF ID='74' REF='58'>the talks</COREF> .
And Thursday, about 3,000 <COREF ID='75' REF='68'>union</COREF> members took part in a lunch-time demonstration in downtown Miami against <COREF ID='76' REF='72'>Texas Air</COREF> and <COREF ID='77' REF='X127'>Gov. Martinez</COREF> .
<COREF ID='78' REF='59'>Mr. Bickford</COREF> said <COREF ID='79' REF='X229'>he</COREF> was so upset by the level and tenor of the recent clamor, that <COREF ID='80' REF='74'>the talks</COREF> were moved for a period in April from Miami, where Eastern is based, to Boston, where <COREF ID='83' REF='80'>he</COREF> hoped things would be quieter.</TXT>
