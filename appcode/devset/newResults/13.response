<COREF ID='X14'>The National Mediation Board</COREF> is expected to release <COREF ID='1' REF='X8'>Pan Am Corp.</COREF> and <COREF ID='2' REF='X6'>its Teamsters union</COREF> from <COREF ID='77' REF='X2'>their long-stalled contract negotiations</COREF> , throwing into question a wage-concession agreement.
<COREF ID='X21'>The release</COREF> means both sides will be asked to submit to arbitration; if one of <COREF ID='X23'>the parties</COREF> refuses, as is expected, a 30-day cooling off period will go into effect, after which <COREF ID='6' REF='2'>the Teamsters</COREF> are free to strike.
William Genoese, <COREF ID='7' REF='6'>head of the airline division of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters</COREF> , said <COREF ID='9' REF='7'>he</COREF> was "shocked and surprised" when <COREF ID='10' REF='7'>he</COREF> heard late Friday from negotiator Walter Wallace of <COREF ID='11' REF='X14'>the board</COREF> 's plans to release <COREF ID='12' REF='X23'>the parties</COREF> from <COREF ID='13' REF='77'>negotiations</COREF> .
At noon EST today, <COREF ID='14' REF='11'>the mediation board</COREF> is expected to ask <COREF ID='15' REF='12'>both parties</COREF> to submit to <COREF ID='16' REF='15'>arbitration</COREF> .
As previously reported, <COREF ID='17' REF='1'>Pan Am</COREF> had asked <COREF ID='18' REF='14'>the National Mediation Board</COREF> to declare an impasse in <COREF ID='19' REF='X2'>the talks</COREF> in late December.
But <COREF ID='20' REF='17'>Pan Am</COREF> , sensing progress in <COREF ID='21' REF='2'>its</COREF> recent negotiations with the unions, asked <COREF ID='22' REF='18'>the board</COREF> to delay acting on <COREF ID='23' REF='10'>the company</COREF> 's request, a source close to <COREF ID='24' REF='18'>the board</COREF> said.
Also as previously reported, <COREF ID='25' REF='20'>Pan Am</COREF> said <COREF ID='X73'>last week</COREF> <COREF ID='26' REF='21'>it</COREF> would make "changes in senior management" in exchange for <COREF ID='X79'>labor-cost concessions</COREF> of $180 million a year for three years from <COREF ID='X74'>the unions</COREF> of its Pan American World Airways unit.
<COREF ID='29' REF='X21'>The agreement</COREF> was reached by a coalition of four of Pan Am's five unions; <COREF ID='31' REF='X74'>the Teamsters union</COREF> was part of <COREF ID='32' REF='26'>that coalition</COREF> -- but has made <COREF ID='X86'>it</COREF> clear recently <COREF ID='33' REF='X86'>it</COREF> did not necessarily go along with <COREF ID='34' REF='29'>the agreement</COREF> .
For the past year, <COREF ID='35' REF='32'>the coalition</COREF> has been trying to force a restructuring of <COREF ID='36' REF='25'>Pan Am</COREF> and <COREF ID='37' REF='X79'>a change in top management</COREF> .
<COREF ID='X108'>Negotiations</COREF> have been held with William T. Coleman, <COREF ID='39' REF='36'>a Pan Am director and Washington attorney</COREF> .
<COREF ID='42' REF='36'>Pan Am</COREF> 's directors are scheduled to meet tomorrow, <COREF ID='43' REF='29'>the deadline set for the union's wage-concession agreement</COREF> .
It wasn't immediately clear if <COREF ID='46' REF='7'>the Teamsters</COREF> 's release might jeopardize <COREF ID='47' REF='43'>that agreement</COREF> .
Last Saturday, <COREF ID='48' REF='46'>Mr. Genoese</COREF> said <COREF ID='49' REF='46'>he</COREF> sent a telegram to Mr. Coleman to announce that <COREF ID='51' REF='46'>the Teamsters</COREF> plan to end <COREF ID='52' REF='23'>their talks with the company</COREF> .
<COREF ID='55' REF='48'>Mr. Genoese</COREF> said <COREF ID='56' REF='51'>he</COREF> had a "cordial" initial meeting with <COREF ID='X133'>Mr. Coleman</COREF> last Thursday, but made no commitment to provide concessions.
" <COREF ID='58' REF='47'>That meeting</COREF> made <COREF ID='X139'>it</COREF> clear to <COREF ID='59' REF='X133'>Mr. Coleman</COREF> that <COREF ID='60' REF='51'>the Teamsters</COREF> and <COREF ID='61' REF='42'>Pan Am</COREF> are still deadlocked," one source close to <COREF ID='62' REF='X108'>the negotiations</COREF> said.
"As far as <COREF ID='63' REF='X73'>we</COREF> 're concerned, <COREF ID='64' REF='52'>the company</COREF> triggered this," <COREF ID='65' REF='55'>Mr. Genoese</COREF> said.
" <COREF ID='66' REF='X73'>We</COREF> 're not negotiating any more with <COREF ID='67' REF='61'>Pan Am</COREF> .
<COREF ID='68' REF='X73'>We</COREF> 're in strike procedure now."
<COREF ID='69' REF='31'>The union</COREF> has already indicated <COREF ID='70' REF='X139'>it</COREF> would not be willing to submit to <COREF ID='71' REF='16'>arbitration</COREF> .
A <COREF ID='72' REF='67'>Pan Am</COREF> spokesman declined to comment.
<COREF ID='73' REF='60'>The Teamsters</COREF> , which represent about 4,500 ticket agents, reservation agents and clerical workers, have been working under a contract that was negotiated in 1978 and scheduled to be renegotiated in 1981.
<COREF ID='74' REF='22'>The federal mediation board</COREF> has rejected several earlier requests by <COREF ID='75' REF='69'>the union</COREF> to declare <COREF ID='76' REF='62'>the negotiations</COREF> deadlocked.
Meanwhile, Pan Am's pilots union said <COREF ID='78' REF='70'>it</COREF> is preparing to sign an agreement to deliver <COREF ID='X175'>concessions</COREF> to <COREF ID='X176'>the company</COREF> <COREF ID='81' REF='X175'>today</COREF> .
A pilot's union spokesman said <COREF ID='X180'>the leaders</COREF> plan to take <COREF ID='83' REF='47'>the agreement</COREF> to <COREF ID='84' REF='52'>their</COREF> membership for ratification.
<COREF ID='85' REF='X180'>He</COREF> said <COREF ID='86' REF='X180'>he</COREF> didn't know how <COREF ID='87' REF='73'>the Teamsters</COREF> action would affect <COREF ID='88' REF='X176'>the union's agreement with the company</COREF> .</TXT>
