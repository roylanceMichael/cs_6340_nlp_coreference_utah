c.1996 South China Morning Post

By JONATHAN HILL and ADAM LEE in Macau <COREF ID='5' REF='X11'>Two Chinese crew members</COREF>

were killed Tuesday when <COREF ID='X25'>their helicopter</COREF> crashed near <COREF ID='8' REF='8'>Macau</COREF> .

The China Southern Helicopter Company <COREF ID='9' REF='9'>aircraft</COREF> was on <COREF ID='10' REF='10'>its</COREF> way to

Zhuhai, apparently returning from an oil rig, when <COREF ID='11' REF='9'>it</COREF> crashed, said

a spokesman for Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department.

Other reports said <COREF ID='13' REF='X25'>the helicopter</COREF> , which went down 10 to 15

nautical miles southeast of the Portuguese enclave, was gathering

weather information. <COREF ID='14' REF='X25'>The incident</COREF> fell within Hong Kong airspace, triggering a search

by Civil Aviation Department rescuers.

Two Government Flying Service helicopters joined <COREF ID='16' REF='8'>Macau</COREF> Marine

Police in <COREF ID='17' REF='X25'>the search</COREF> for <COREF ID='18' REF='X25'>the Sikorsky 76</COREF> . <COREF ID='19' REF='19'>Mainland</COREF> authorities later told <COREF ID='20' REF='X25'>the department</COREF> 's Aeronautical

Rescue Co-ordination Centre the wreckage had been recovered from

the Chinese island of <COREF ID='21' REF='21'>Daiwaishan</COREF> .

``Someone on <COREF ID='22' REF='X25'>the island</COREF> heard a noise and called <COREF ID='23' REF='23'>Zhuhai</COREF> airport

authorities,'' said a <COREF ID='24' REF='8'>Macau</COREF> aviation source. `` <COREF ID='25' REF='X3'>China</COREF> sent a

helicopter and confirmed <COREF ID='26' REF='X3'>the crash</COREF> on <COREF ID='27' REF='X25'>the island</COREF> .'' <COREF ID='28' REF='8'>Macau</COREF> authorities, who lost radar contact at 10 am, said <COREF ID='29' REF='X25'>the pilots</COREF> had been found at the site ``and appeared dead''. <COREF ID='30' REF='23'>Zhuhai</COREF> officials confirmed <COREF ID='31' REF='5'>the crew</COREF> had been killed.

Sources suggested that poor weather was <COREF ID='32' REF='X3'>the likely cause of the crash</COREF> .

The Royal Observatory reported strong winds in the area at <COREF ID='34' REF='X25'>the time</COREF> . Rescuers also reported poor visibility. <COREF ID='35' REF='X3'>China</COREF> , as <COREF ID='36' REF='X25'>the country of registration</COREF> , would investigate <COREF ID='37' REF='X25'>the incident</COREF> , the <COREF ID='38' REF='20'>Civil Aviation Department</COREF> said.
